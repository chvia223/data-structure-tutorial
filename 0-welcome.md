# Welcome!
This is a tutorial course on some data structures you'll encounter on your programming journey. It is not an end all be all selection, but what is here should be helpful to you.

What is expected of you is that you know how to program in Python. It is preferred that you know how to use Python's object-oriented programming semantics as well.
